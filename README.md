# Gambler's Ruin Problem Analysis

---

## Overview

This project focuses on simulating and analyzing the **Gambler's Ruin Problem**, a fundamental concept in probability theory that models the likelihood of a gambler's bankruptcy (ruin) over time given certain probabilities of winning and losing. The problem is explored by simulating multiple iterations and comparing the results with theoretical solutions derived from difference equations. The analysis considers the influence of the probability of winning ($P$), initial units ($K$), and total units ($N$) on the ruin probability $U_k$.

The program consists of:

- Simulating the gambler’s ruin problem for varying conditions.
- Comparing simulated results with theoretical predictions.
- Visualizing the effect of changing parameters (e.g., initial units, probability of winning) on the ruin probability.

The project is significant due to its applications in various fields, including **financial modeling**, **risk management**, and **decision theory**.

## Problem Definition

### 1. Mathematical Formulation

The Gambler's Ruin problem involves two players:

- **Player $I$** starts with $K$ units of money.
- **Player $D$** starts with $N - K$ units, where $N$ is the total number of units in play.

#### Key Variables

- **$P$**: The probability that player $I$ wins a round.
- **$q = 1 - P$**: The probability that player $D$ wins a round.
- **$U_k$**: The probability that player $I$ will be ruined starting with $K$ units.

#### Difference Equation

The ruin probability $U_k$ satisfies a recurrence relation:
$$ U_{k+1} - U_k = \frac{q}{P} (U_{k-1} - U_k) $$

with boundary conditions:
$$ U_0 = 1 \quad \text{(certain ruin if player $I$ has 0 units)} $$
$$ U_N = 0 \quad \text{(player $D$ is ruined if $I$ reaches $N$ units)} $$

#### Theoretical Solution

- If **$P = q$**, the ruin probability is linear:
  $$ U_k = 1 - \frac{K}{N} $$
  
- If **$P \neq q$**, the solution is exponential:
  $$ U_k = \frac{\left(\frac{q}{P}\right)^K - \left(\frac{q}{P}\right)^N}{1 - \left(\frac{q}{P}\right)^N} $$

### 2. Simulation Methodology

To simulate the gambler's ruin problem, the code performs the following:

1. **Simulate multiple sample paths**: Player $I$ either wins or loses one unit based on a random number generated for each round.
2. **Stop when a player is ruined**: The simulation continues until player $I$ either wins all units or loses all their money.
3. **Compute ruin probabilities**: The fraction of paths that end with player $I$ losing all their money is recorded as the estimated ruin probability.

The simulation results are compared against theoretical predictions.

## Key Concepts

### Mathematical Concepts

- **Difference Equations**: These are recursive relations used to compute the ruin probability by relating values at successive steps.
  
- **Markov Processes**: The gambler's ruin can be modeled as a Markov process where the state transitions (winning or losing a round) depend only on the current state and not the previous history.
  
- **Probability Theory**: Central to the gambler's ruin problem, probability theory is used to model the likelihood of specific outcomes (win, lose, ruin).

### Dependencies

- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations, including simulations of random processes and matrix manipulations.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed to visualize the results, including the relationship between ruin probability and parameters such as $P$ and $K$.
- **Warnings**: Suppressed to ensure smooth execution when handling edge cases like extreme probabilities.

## Simulated Results vs. Theoretical Predictions

### Simulated Scenarios

1. **Ruin Probability vs. Winning Probability ($P$)**:
   - For different values of starting units $K$, the ruin probability $U_k$ is plotted as a function of $P$.
   - Results show that as $P$ increases (i.e., player $I$ has a higher probability of winning each round), the probability of ruin decreases.

2. **Ruin Probability vs. Initial Units ($K$)**:
   - For varying values of $K$, the ruin probability $U_k$ is plotted for fixed winning probabilities $P$.
   - Results demonstrate that starting with more units ($K$) significantly reduces the likelihood of ruin.

### Observations from Analysis

1. **For Equal Win/Loss Probability ($P = 0.5$)**:
   - The ruin probability decreases linearly as $K$ increases, as both players have an equal chance of winning a round.
  
2. **For Imbalanced Win/Loss Probability ($P \neq 0.5$)**:
   - When $P$ is either high or low, the curves are more nonlinear, indicating faster divergence in the probability of ruin. For example, if player $I$ has a higher chance of winning, ruin is less likely.

3. **Accuracy of Simulations**:
   - Simulated results closely match the theoretical predictions, affirming the correctness of the simulation approach.

## Applications

### Practical Applications

- **Financial Markets**: The gambler’s ruin problem can model investment risks and capital depletion scenarios.
- **Insurance**: Actuarial science often uses similar probabilistic models to assess risk of ruin for insurance companies over time.
- **Decision Theory**: The model can guide decision-making under uncertainty, providing insights into optimal strategies for survival under risk.

### Future Extensions

- **Variable Bet Sizes**: The current model assumes fixed bet sizes. Future models could explore variable bet sizes to reflect real-world gambling or financial investment strategies.
- **Stop-Loss Conditions**: Incorporating stop-loss conditions could model risk management strategies, where a gambler or investor halts play after losing a predefined amount.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the Gambler’s Ruin problem provides both theoretical and practical insights into risk management and decision-making under uncertainty. Through simulation and mathematical formulation, this project demonstrates the fundamental principles of probability theory in modeling ruin scenarios, making it applicable in fields such as finance, insurance, and beyond. The strong agreement between simulated results and theoretical solutions further validates the robustness of the model.
